# FaceGuard :closed_lock_with_key:

Welcome to **FaceGuard**! This project is a demo application showcasing the potential of integrating facial recognition into security solutions. Using machine learning and computer vision, it lays down the foundation for a larger, more optimized system.

## Description :book:

FaceGuard is a facial recognition tool that utilizes machine learning, implementing the `InceptionResnetV1` model from the `facenet-pytorch` library, to recognize and manage facial data. It demonstrates basic functionalities such as training on new faces, managing face data, and locking the screen upon detecting an unrecognized face, serving as a stepping stone for more advanced and optimized applications in the realms of security and user authentication.

## Technologies Used :gear:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video input and image processing.
- **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used for training and running the facial recognition model.
- **facenet-pytorch**: Provides the pre-trained `InceptionResnetV1` model for facial recognition.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For image manipulation and processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and managing data in array format.
- **Pickle**: For serializing and de-serializing Python object structures.
- **shutil**: For high-level file operations.
- **ctypes**: For interacting with the Windows API to lock the screen.

## Optimization Opportunities :bulb:

FaceGuard, as a demonstration, provides a basis upon which more features and optimizations can be introduced. Here are some ways it can be enhanced:

1. **Model Optimization**: Employ more advanced and efficient facial recognition models, and explore techniques like model quantization and pruning for better performance.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset, improving model robustness.
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Optimize the system for real-time facial recognition, enhancing its applicability in dynamic environments.
4. **Security Measures**: Introduce additional security features, such as encryption for stored facial data and multi-factor authentication.
5. **User Interface**: Develop a more interactive and user-friendly interface for managing and training facial data.
6. **Cloud Integration**: Explore cloud-based solutions for storing and processing facial data, allowing for scalability and remote access.
